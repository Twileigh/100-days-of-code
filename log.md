# 100 Days of Code - Log 

### Day 0 - May 22, 2020

**GOALS**: I will be dual learning Kotlin and learning how to properly use Git/Github. Initially, I will spend 1 hour on each topic/day. When I feel comfortable with the what I am learning, then I will begin to build and use knowledge to create. 

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1400: I was able to set-up the initial forked repo, gathered materials, built and organized the project. 
-

**Thoughts**: 
- 1400 - Super motivated. I need to pan for down days and ensure I stay focused. 

**Link to work**: None
