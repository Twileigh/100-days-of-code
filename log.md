# 100 Days of Code - Log 

### Day 0 - May 22, 2020

This is my coding diary!

**GOALS**: I will be dual learning Kotlin and learning how to properly use Git/Github. Initially, I will spend 1 hour on each topic/day. When I feel comfortable with the what I am learning, then I will begin to build projects. As I learn, I will be making lists 
of projects I want to build.  


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1400: I was able to set-up the initial forked repo, gathered materials, built and organized the project. 
- 2230: Halfway through Git/Github course on learning.oreilly.com. Pretty pumped. Learned Basics of Kotlin up to functions and classes. Will continue with those tomorrow.
- 0000: Learned git checkout, revert, reset, .gitignore file. I am moving onwards toward basics of GitHub.
- 0041: Calling it quits for the night. 2 Hours on Kotlin, 3 on Git/Github. 

**Thoughts**: 
- 1400 - Super motivated. I need to pan for down days and ensure I stay focused. 
- 2300 - I should schedule in review time slots each morning moving forward to ensure 
retention.
- 0045 - WTF AM I GOING TO BUILD?

**Link to work**: None

### Day 1: May 23, 2020

**DAILY GOALS**: Finish the Git/GitHub course. Continue on learning Kotlin. Look into android development so I am able to apply the learnings and build applications.

**Today's Progress**:
- 2000 - Kids are finally asleep. Day 1 has begun. 
- 0000 - Finished Git/Github course. Feeling great! Solid understanding of Git now. I will continue to work with Git/GitHub for each project throughout #100daysofcode

**Thoughts**: 
- Why did it take me so long to learn Git?? I should have learned a DVCS when learning web dev.
- Finding it a little difficult to find and stick to one learning material on Kotlin...I need to stop looking for material and create material!



**Link to work**: None.

## Day 2: May 25, 2020

**DAILY GOALS**:  I will step back on Kotlin and continue learning the power of functions and classes. I will create multiple projects and create classes and functions and test my knowledge. 

**Today's Progress**:
- 2100 - Finally able to start learning. Kids are asleep and wife doesn't have any more adventures planned. 
- 2300 - Had to look up more stuff on Functions and Classes for Kotlin 
- 0000 - Moved on from functions and classes for the time being. Spending rest of night reviewing and writing small projects with material I know. 

**Thoughts**:
- I need to really focus on one resource for Kotlin and stop looking for more if I find myself in a rut, 


**Link to work**: None. Plan on linking work by day 14. End of second week. 

## Day 3: May 26, 2020

**DAILY GOALS**: Review material throughout the day and apply material at night.

**Today's Progress**: 
- 2357 - reviewd a ot of material on Functions and classes, I was able to use the material I learned to create first small project. The big thing is getting it done and committing it to GitHub!

**Thoughts**: 
- Full time job + 2 kids + College = Tough as fuck! It is rewarding though!
