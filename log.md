# 100 Days of Code - Log 

### Day 0 - May 22, 2020

This is my coding diary!

**GOALS**: I will be dual learning Kotlin and learning how to properly use Git/Github. Initially, I will spend 1 hour on each topic/day. When I feel comfortable with the what I am learning, then I will begin to build projects. As I learn, I will be making lists 
of projects I want to build.  


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1400: I was able to set-up the initial forked repo, gathered materials, built and organized the project. 
- 2230: Halfway through Git/Github course on learning.oreilly.com. Pretty pumped. Learned Basics of Kotlin up to functions and classes. Will continue with those tomorrow.
- 0000: Learned git checkout, revert, reset, .gitignore file. I am moving onwards toward basics of GitHub.
- 0041: Calling it quits for the night. 2 Hours on Kotlin, 3 on Git/Github. 

**Thoughts**: 
- 1400 - Super motivated. I need to pan for down days and ensure I stay focused. 
- 2300 - I should schedule in review time slots each morning moving forward to ensure 
retention.
- 0045 - WTF AM I GOING TO BUILD?

**Link to work**: None
